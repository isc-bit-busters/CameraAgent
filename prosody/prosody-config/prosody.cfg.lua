-- Prosody Example Configuration File
--
-- Information on configuring Prosody can be found on our
-- website at https://prosody.im/doc/configure
--
-- Tip: You can check that the syntax of this file is correct
-- when you have finished by running this command:
--     prosodyctl check config
-- If there are any errors, it will let you know what and where
-- they are, otherwise it will keep quiet.
--
-- The only thing left to do is rename this file to remove the .dist ending, and fill in the
-- blanks. Good luck, and happy Jabbering!


pidfile = "/var/run/prosody/prosody.pid"

---------- Server-wide settings ----------
-- Settings in this section apply to the whole server and are the default settings
-- for any virtual hosts

-- This is a (by default, empty) list of accounts that are admins
-- for the server. Note that you must create the accounts separately
-- (see https://prosody.im/doc/creating_accounts for info)
-- Example: admins = { "user1@example.com", "user2@example.net" }
admins = { }

-- Enable use of libevent for better performance under high load
-- For more information see: https://prosody.im/doc/libevent
--use_libevent = true

-- Prosody will always look in its source directory for modules, but
-- this option allows you to specify additional locations where Prosody
-- will look for modules first. For community modules, see https://modules.prosody.im/
--plugin_paths = {}

-- This is the list of modules Prosody will load on startup.
-- It looks for mod_modulename.lua in the plugins folder, so make sure that exists too.
-- Documentation for bundled modules can be found at: https://prosody.im/doc/modules

-- daemonize=false
modules_enabled = {
    -- Core required modules
    "roster";           -- Contact list
    "saslauth";         -- Authentication
    "tls";              -- TLS encryption
    "dialback";         -- Server-to-server dialback protocol
    "disco";            -- Service discovery
    
    -- Essential modules
    "private";          -- Private XML storage
    "vcard";            -- User metadata storage
    "version";          -- Responds to server version requests
    "uptime";           -- Report how long server has been running
    "time";             -- Let others know the time here on this server
    "ping";             -- Ping clients to ensure they are still connected
    
    -- SPADE needed modules
    "carbons";          -- Message carbons for multi-device support
    "blocklist";        -- Allow users to block communications
    "register";         -- Allow users to register by themselves
}

-- These modules are auto-loaded, but should you want
-- to disable them then uncomment them here:
modules_disabled = {
	-- "offline"; -- Store offline messages
	-- "c2s"; -- Handle client connections
	-- "s2s"; -- Handle server-to-server connections
	-- "posix"; -- POSIX functionality, sends server to background, enables syslog, etc.
}

-- Disable account creation by default, for security
-- For more information see https://prosody.im/doc/creating_accounts
allow_registration = true

-- Force clients to use encrypted connections? This option will
-- prevent clients from authenticating unless they are using encryption.

c2s_require_encryption = false

-- Force servers to use encrypted connections? This option will
-- prevent servers from authenticating unless they are using encryption.

s2s_require_encryption = false

-- Force certificate authentication for server-to-server connections?

s2s_secure_auth = false

-- Some servers have invalid or self-signed certificates. You can list
-- remote domains here that will not be required to authenticate using
-- certificates. They will be authenticated using DNS instead, even
-- when s2s_secure_auth is enabled.

--s2s_insecure_domains = { "insecure.example" }

-- Even if you disable s2s_secure_auth, you can still require valid
-- certificates for some domains by specifying a list here.

--s2s_secure_domains = { "jabber.org" }

-- Enable rate limits for incoming client and server connections

limits = {
  stanza_size=512000;
  c2s = {
    rate = "10kb/s";
  };
  s2sin = {
    rate = "30kb/s";
  };
}

-- Select the authentication backend to use. The 'internal' providers
-- use Prosody's configured data storage to store the authentication data.

authentication = "internal_plain"

-- Select the storage backend to use. By default Prosody uses flat files
-- in its configured data directory, but it also supports more backends
-- through modules. An "sql" backend is included by default, but requires
-- additional dependencies. See https://prosody.im/doc/storage for more info.

--storage = "sql" -- Default is "internal"

-- For the "sql" backend, you can uncomment *one* of the below to configure:
--sql = { driver = "SQLite3", database = "prosody.sqlite" } -- Default. 'database' is the filename.
--sql = { driver = "MySQL", database = "prosody", username = "prosody", password = "secret", host = "localhost" }
--sql = { driver = "PostgreSQL", database = "prosody", username = "prosody", password = "secret", host = "localhost" }


-- Archiving configuration
-- If mod_mam is enabled, Prosody will store a copy of every message. This
-- is used to synchronize conversations between multiple clients, even if
-- they are offline. This setting controls how long Prosody will keep
-- messages in the archive before removing them.

archive_expires_after = "1w" -- Remove archived messages after 1 week

-- You can also configure messages to be stored in-memory only. For more
-- archiving options, see https://prosody.im/doc/modules/mod_mam

-- Logging configuration
-- For advanced logging see https://prosody.im/doc/logging
log = {
    info = "*console";
    error = "*console";
}

-- Uncomment to enable statistics
-- For more info see https://prosody.im/doc/statistics
-- statistics = "internal"

-- Certificates
-- Every virtual host and component needs a certificate so that clients and
-- servers can securely verify its identity. Prosody will automatically load
-- certificates/keys from the directory specified here.
-- For more information, including how to use 'prosodyctl' to auto-import certificates
-- (from e.g. Let's Encrypt) see https://prosody.im/doc/certificates

-- Location of directory to find certificates in (relative to main config file):
certificates = "certs"

-- HTTPS currently only supports a single certificate, specify it here:
--https_certificate = "/etc/prosody/certs/localhost.crt"

----------- Virtual hosts -----------
-- You need to add a VirtualHost entry for each domain you wish Prosody to serve.
-- Settings under each VirtualHost entry apply *only* to that host.

VirtualHost "localhost"
    authentication = "internal_plain"

VirtualHost "prosody"
    authentication = "internal_plain"

--VirtualHost "example.com"
--	certificate = "/path/to/example.crt"

------ Components ------
-- You can specify components to add hosts that provide special services,
-- like multi-user conferences, and transports.
-- For more information on components, see https://prosody.im/doc/components

---Set up a MUC (multi-user chat) room server on conference.example.com:
--Component "conference.example.com" "muc"
--- Store MUC messages in an archive and allow users to access it
--modules_enabled = { "muc_mam" }

---Set up an external component (default component port is 5347)
--
-- External components allow adding various services, such as gateways/
-- transports to other networks like ICQ, MSN and Yahoo. For more info
-- see: https://prosody.im/doc/components#adding_an_external_component
--
--Component "gateway.example.com"
--	component_secret = "password"

-- Include other prosody config
--Include "conf.d/*.cfg.lua"
